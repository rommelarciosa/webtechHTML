     <p class = "gamer_p">I really like playing computer games especially DOTA2, it all started when I was in High School because my friends are always asking me to play, And out of curiosity I tried to play it, its was really enjoyable. Me and my friends are always competing with others and the feeling when you defeat them because of your strategy and they look at you as a Pro at playing Dota2.  </p>

     <p class = "dance_p"> I love dancing because there is so much passion and emotion in every movement, and in dancing I can also make many friend because dancing is universal many people can appreciate it. It's also a way to express myself. Happiness, Love or Anger what ever the emotion I may have. There's no right or wrong because there's a total freedom in dancing.</p>

  <h3 class = "plants_h3">Plants</h3>  
     <p class = "plants_p">I feel so relaxed everytime see many plants, its just because it feels so natural and safe and comfortable. maybe because of how green they are or how beautiful they are. I Grew up close to my grandmother who really loves to plant. In her house it looks like garden, Me ,my siblings and cousins always play there, So maybe thats the main reason why I feel so relaxed, because it makes me nostalgic. </p>
